[Project home page](https://www.weblin.io/) 

To make the Web a vibrant space where people meet and interact, and live.

There are many people on the same Web pages at the same time. Weblin makes them visible, so they can talk, videoconf, game, hangout, rally, or meet by chance on the Web pages they visit.

Weblin creates a social layer above all Web pages. Web pages turn into chat rooms with animated avatars, people and things.

Because the Web is there and the people are there. They are just not visible. It's like walking on the street in the real world without the people. Like entering a shop or sitting in the caf√© reading the newspaper, but nobody is there.

In the real world there are people, friends, strangers, passersby, waiters, salespeople. That's nice. It is good to see them and being able to talk to them. That's what we want for the Web part of The Metaverse.
